**Income Level Prediction
**
This project uses machine learning to predict income levels based on demographic and personal attributes. The dataset includes information about developers, such as their age, gender, area of residence, immigration status, English proficiency, education level, and reported income.

Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Developer: Developer's role or background (categorical).
Age: Age of the individual (numerical, may contain missing values).
Gender: Gender of the individual (categorical).
Area: Area of residence (categorical).
Immigrant: Immigration status (categorical).
English: English proficiency (categorical).
Education: Highest education level attained (categorical).
Income: Income level (categorical, target variable).
Data Summary:
Total entries: 16,702
Missing values: Present in multiple columns, especially for the target variable Income.
Project Objectives

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values appropriately.
Encode categorical variables for machine learning models.
Normalize or scale numerical data if needed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Visualize correlations between features and income levels.
Model Development:
Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict income levels.
Experiment with various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Deployment (Optional):
Create a simple interface for users to input personal attributes and receive income predictions.
Requirements

Python 3.8+
Required libraries:
pandas
